### Adjustments for Slopes Greater Than 1 in Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm

- **Iteration Along Y-Axis:**

  - Instead of iterating along the x-axis, the algorithm advances along the y-axis.
  - Each step maintains a constant change in the y-coordinate, simplifying calculations.

- **Interchange of Roles of X and Y:**

  - The roles of x and y are swapped, altering the heading of traversal.
  - Pixel selection and parameter calculations prioritize changes in the y-coordinate.

- **Adjustment of Decision Parameter:**
  - The decision parameter (D) is recalculated based on changes in the y-coordinate.
  - Ensures precise determination of pixel selection along the line's trajectory.
